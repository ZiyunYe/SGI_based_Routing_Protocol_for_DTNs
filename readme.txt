This is the course project by Ziyun Ye and Seungbae Kim. All rights reserved. In the project we used the ONE simulator(Ari Keranen, Jorg Ott and Teemu Karkkainen: The ONE Simulator for DTN Protocol Evaluation. SIMUTools'09: 2nd International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques. Rome, March 2009. )

In the project, we proposed a SGI based routing protocol, which uses mobility pattern gained from online social network services to forward message to nodes who are more likely to meet with destination. Then we implemented the SGI data collector by using Instagram Python API and simulated the proposed SGI based routing protocol in the ONE simulator. Finally we achieved similar delivery ratio but 80% less network overhead compared with Epidemic routing protocol. For more information, please refer to the paper in the project file.
